/**
 * TODO
 *
 * H2 database should be started before probe is started.
 * Usually H2 started in memory mode for such examples,
 * but we need to start it as separated service to have possibility to connect to this server from generator application
 * and prepare JSON model stub based on it.
 *
 * Start H2 server this helper allows to
 *  - start TCP server and
 *  - creates demo database schema, fill it with data.
 *
 *  This utility added just for convenience. You can start via h2 jars files - http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html
 * and install data with northwind.sql before using this example.
