                Before you get involved in Apache NLPCraft development, please sign up to the
                dev mailing list by sending an empty email to <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@ignite.apache.org">dev-subscribe@ignite.apache.org</a>
                and follow simple instructions in the reply. Once subscribed, say "Hello" to everyone in the community.
                Tell us as much as you can about your areas of expertise mentioning how exactly you would like to
                contribute. We are a friendly and inclusive community and will try to simplify your "onboarding"
                considering your strengths or areas of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, make sure to share your JIRA ID in the same email (create
                a <a target="jira" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NLPCRAFT">new one</a> if you don't have an ASF JIRA account yet).
                One of our community members will add you to the contributors' list and you will be able to
                go ahead and book NLPCraft tasks you would like to work on.
            </p>
            <span class="section-sub-title">NLPCraft Dev List</span>
            <p>
                This list is the primary and the default communication channel - <a href="mailto:dev@nlpcraft.apache.org">dev@nlpcraft.apache.org</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Send an email to <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@ignite.apache.org">dev-subscribe@ignite.apache.org</a>
                to subscribe to the list. If you are an ASF committer, then it's better to use your <code>@apache.org</code>
                address for NLPCraft communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the discussions related to contributions, changes, new ideas have to be started on the dev list
                first. Remember the mantra - <b>"If it's not on the dev list, it didn't happen".</b> The project is
                being developed and moved forward by individuals living across the globe and speaking different
                languages. Thus, <a target="asf" href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#communication">asynchronous written communication</a>
                is a preferred way of engagement at ASF as well as within the NLPCraft community.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the sake of openness, speed and transparency, the community members are free to use Slack, Skype or
                meet via the tools like Google Meeting. But, as mentioned above, if any conversation took place between
                contributors using channels like Slack, a summary of the discussion/decision has to be shared via the
                dev list letting other contributors share their opinions. As a summary, final decisions are made only
                on the dev list.
            </p>
            <span class="section-sub-title">Contribution Process</span>
            <p>
                Before you start contributing, spend some time to get to know how <a target="asf" href="https://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">Apache Software Foundation</a>
                works and <a target="asf" href="http://www.apache.org/theapacheway/index.html">The Apache Way</a> that helps
                us, as a group of professionals, drive the project forward in a respectful and inclusive way.
            </p>
            <span class="section-sub-title">JIRA Tickets</span>
            <p>
                <a target="jira" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NLPCRAFT/issues">NLPCraft JIRA</a>
                drives all activities in the project. Any tasks, of any complexity, for any component
                in the main project or satellite projects has corresponding ticket in JIRA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you can start contributing you need to pick an unassigned ticket and assign to yourself. Look
                through all tickets paying attention to
                <a target="jira" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20NLPCRAFT%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)">unassigned tickets with label <code>newbie</code></a>
                suited for the quick start.
                Still haven't found anything suitable? As always, check the latest discussions on <a target="asf" href="https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/nlpcraft-dev/">dev@nlpcraft.apache.org</a>

            <span class="section-sub-title">Git Workflow</span>
            <p>
                NLPCraft project uses Git as its version control system. The same Git workflow rules apply to all
                sub-projects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>master</code> branch represents latest released version (i.e. the latest release).
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Each release has corresponding Git tag.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>release</code> branch represent a root branch for the current release that is under development.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            During release the <code>release</code> branch gets merged to <code>master</code>, Git tag
                            is created and work on the next release continues with <code>release</code> branch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>master</code> branch gets updated <b>only</b> during release process.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Committers use feature branches for their work, while contributors use pull-requests from GitHub mirror.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Feature branches should be named after their JIRA tickets, i.e. for ticket <code>NLPCRAFT-012</code>
                            the branch should be named <code>NLPCRAFT-012</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Committers create feature branches off the <code>release</code> branch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Merging should use Git <code>squashing</code> to minimize number of intermittent commits.
                </li>
            </ul>
