    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed <a target="github" href="https://github.com/nlpcrafters/nlpcraft/issues/29">Issue #29</a>.
            <p>
                Introduced custom user-defined model element parser. See <code>NCModel#getParser()</code> method.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default the semantic data model detects its elements by their synonyms declared in the model. However,
                in some cases the synonyms (or the regular expressions) are simply not expressive enough. In such cases,
                a user-defined custom parser can be defined for the model that would allow the user to define its own
                logic to detect the model elements in the user input programmatically. Note that there can be only one
                custom parser per model and it can detect any number of model elements.
            </p>

                Introduced integration with <a target=_ href="https://spring.io/">Spring Framework</a> so that data model can be instantiated and configured
                inside the data probes using Spring. New example <a target="github" href="https://github.com/nlpcrafters/nlpcraft/tree/master/src/main/scala/org/nlpcraft/examples/names">Names</a> added to demonstrate usage of the Spring integration.

                    configuration.
