        <li>
            Server configuration property for base NLP engine <code>server.nlp.engine</code> is removed and replaced by
            the system property <code>NLPCRAFT_NLP_ENGINE</code>. That system property can have two values:
            <code>opennlp</code> for Apache OpenNLP and <code>stanford</code> for Stanford CoreNLP engine. This
            system property must be set to the same value on both server and the probe JVMs. If not set
            the default NLP engine will be Apache OpenNLP.
