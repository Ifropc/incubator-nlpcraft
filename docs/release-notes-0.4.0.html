                This issues was about removing the redundant data source entity from Data Model API. Notice that
                this involved removing <code>NCDataSource</code> interface, as well as corresponding REST APIs.
                Recompilation and potential refactoring of your code is required.
                Note also that you will need to reset your NLPCraft database if use a NLPCraft version prior to
                <code>0.4.0.</code>
            </div>
            <p>
                See fixed <a target="github" href="https://github.com/nlpcrafters/nlpcraft/issues/7">Issue #7</a>
                that introduced the ability to pass extra data with <code>/ask</code> REST call replacing
                the need for the former data source configuration.

            System property <code>NLPCRAFT_DB_INITIALIZE</code> was renamed to <code>NLPCRAFT_IGNITE_DB_INITIALIZE</code>
            to better indicate that it only applies to Ignite database option.
